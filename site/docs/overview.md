# Overview

[GitHub workflows][github_workflows_link] are configurable, automated processes that can run at various points during the development process. For example, a workflow can run when a pull request is created or updated to perform various code quality checks before allowing the changes to be merged.

Mindful Software Workflows is a collection of workflows that we use at VGV to run automated checks in our CI pipelines. While built by VGV to be used internally, they can be used by anyone.

## Quick Start ðŸš€
